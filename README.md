# BJJ API Docker Local Network

## Overview

This project sets up a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) API within a local Docker network, facilitating isolated development and testing environments.

## Features

- **Dockerized Environment**: Utilizes Docker to containerize the BJJ API, ensuring consistent environments across different setups.
- **Local Networking**: Establishes a dedicated Docker network for seamless communication between containers without external interference.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multi-container applications. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zep1994/bjj-api-docker-local-network.git
   cd bjj-api-docker-local-network
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t bjj-api .
   ```

3. **Create a Docker Network**:
   ```bash
   docker network create bjj-network
   ```

4. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run --network bjj-network --name bjj-api-container -d bjj-api
   ```

5. **Verify the Setup**:
   Access the API at `http://localhost:PORT`, replacing `PORT` with the exposed port defined in the Dockerfile or Docker Compose configuration.

## Usage

Once the container is running:

- **Access API Endpoints**: Use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API.
- **Monitor Logs**:
  ```bash
  docker logs bjj-api-container
  ```

## Development

For development purposes:

1. **Access the Running Container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it bjj-api-container /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Modify Code**: Changes can be made directly within the container or by mounting local directories.

3. **Restart the Container** to apply changes:
   ```bash
   docker restart bjj-api-container
   ```
